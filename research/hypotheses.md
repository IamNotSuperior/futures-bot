# Strategy hypothesis log

One entry per strategy idea. **The entry is written before any code**, with the
mechanism stated up front — why the edge should exist, and who is on the other
side of the trade. An idea that cannot name its counterparty is a pattern, not a
hypothesis, and patterns are what overfitting is made of.

The verdict is filled in after walk-forward evaluation and is not revised
afterwards. A rejected entry stays in the log with its verdict intact; the point
of the log is to make it expensive to quietly re-test the same idea until it
passes.

## Standard of evidence

An idea is **accepted** only if, on walk-forward with yearly folds
(`backtests/walkforward.py`):

- it is profitable in a majority of folds, **and**
- total walk-forward P&L is positive after commission and slippage, **and**
- it survives at 2 ticks of slippage per side.

Anything else is **rejected**. In-sample results are never evidence.

## 1. Opening Range Breakout (ORB) — REJECTED

**Date:** 2026-09-03
**Commit:** `b8e9411` (walk-forward framework and results)
**Code:** `strategies/orb.py`
**Instrument:** MES, 5-minute bars, RTH only

### Mechanism claimed

The first 15 minutes of the RTH session establish a reference range while
overnight news is absorbed and the opening auction imbalance clears. A decisive
break of that range was claimed to indicate that one side of the order book has
been exhausted, with continuation as remaining liquidity is taken.

**Who is on the other side:** the claim was that fading the break is done by
mean-reversion traders and overnight position-holders covering, who are slower
to reprice than the breakout flow. This was never established independently —
it was assumed from the pattern's popularity rather than from any measurement of
order flow. In hindsight this is the entry's weakest point, and it should have
been treated as a warning before any code was written.

### Parameters tested

| Parameter | Grid |
|---|---|
| Opening range | 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes |
| Trading window end | 10:30, 11:30, 12:30 ET |
| Stop | 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5 × opening-range height |
| Target | 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 × stop distance |

192 combinations. Defaults: 15m / 11:30 / 1.0 / 2.0.

### Walk-forward verdict: REJECTED

Seven yearly folds, 2020–2026, parameters chosen on prior years only, 1 tick
slippage per side and $1.25/side commission:

| Test year | Chosen params | Train Sharpe | OOS P&L | OOS Sharpe | OOS PF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2020 | 10m/10:30/1.0/3.0 | 0.48 | −$3,685 | −2.18 | 0.71 |
| 2021 | 30m/11:30/0.5/3.0 | −0.78 | −$1,868 | −2.13 | 0.74 |
| 2022 | 5m/10:30/0.75/3.0 | −0.24 | −$1,690 | −1.02 | 0.87 |
| 2023 | 30m/10:30/1.0/3.0 | 0.20 | +$484 | 0.49 | 1.08 |
| 2024 | 30m/10:30/1.5/1.5 | 0.37 | +$90 | 0.07 | 1.01 |
| 2025 | 30m/10:30/1.5/1.5 | 0.31 | +$1,167 | 0.65 | 1.11 |
| 2026 | 30m/10:30/1.5/2.0 | 0.44 | −$571 | −0.58 | 0.91 |

**Total: −$6,072.81 over 1,409 trades. 3 of 7 folds profitable. Median fold
Sharpe −0.585.**

Fails the first two acceptance criteria outright; the 2-tick check was not run
because it can only make a losing result worse.

### What was learned

**A favourable window flattered it badly.** The first backtest ran 2024-09 to
2026-08 and returned +$2,250. That window happens to contain the two best folds
(2025 at +$1,167 and 2024 at +$90) and none of 2020–2022, which lost $7,243
between them. The two-year number was a favourable draw, not a small sample of a
positive edge.

**Parameter ranking transfers, and it does not help.** Pooled Spearman
correlation between training and test Sharpe was **+0.398**, positive in all
seven folds (+0.11 to +0.77). Selection is not the failure — a chosen set lands
at the 55th percentile of its own test year, marginally better than the median.
The strategy is simply unprofitable, and reliably ranking among losers still
returns a loser. Worth recording because the earlier single-split scan reported
a rank correlation of −0.005 and the conclusion drawn then, that in-sample
ranking carries no information, was itself a small-sample artifact.

**Costs dominate.** At the defaults over 2024–2026, gross P&L was $5,300 against
$3,050 of commission and slippage: friction consumed 58% of gross. A strategy
whose best in-sample profit factor is ~1.3 has no room for an extra tick.

### Next

Do not re-test ORB with a wider grid or different exits. The grid was already
192 combinations across four parameters; widening it searches harder for noise.
Any future breakout idea must first establish the counterparty claim
independently of backtest results.

```
## N. <Name> — PROPOSED | ACCEPTED | REJECTED

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Commit:** <hash>
**Code:** <path, or "not yet written">
**Instrument:** MES | MNQ, timeframe

### Mechanism claimed
Why this should work. What structural feature of the market creates it.

**Who is on the other side:** name the counterparty and why they trade the
losing side knowingly. "Retail" is not an answer; state what constrains them.

### Parameters tested
Grid, and the defaults.

### Walk-forward verdict
Per-fold table, totals, rank correlation. Filled in after the run, never before.

### What was learned
Including what would have to be true for the idea to be revisited.
